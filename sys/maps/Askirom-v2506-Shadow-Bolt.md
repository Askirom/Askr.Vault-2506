# ASKIROM v2506 — THE SHADOW PATH

> A Shadow Bolt doesn't apologize for its nature; it simply knows the difference between emerging with purpose and sparking at random.

**Theme: The Chaotic Void** — An action is a focused strike of pure potential, drawn from the chaos of the void. It defines its own meaning, independent of external light or judgment.

### 🔹 PURPOSE & GOALS

1. **Real-Life Decision Framework** — “What would I do if I trusted my intrinsic nature?”
2. **Integrated Character Sheet** — Stats, abilities, gear, quests, and counters live _here_.
3. **Aspirational Growth Model** — Become someone who works _with_ their brain, not against it.

---

### 🔹 OPERATING CONTEXT

> [!info]
> • **ADHD** — external scaffolding is non-negotiable; proactive energy management beats brute discipline.
> • **Aphantasia** — zero internal visuals → writing, sketching, motion are core cognition.

---

### 🔹 PERSONALITY PROFILE

> [!note] Core Mindset & Drive
> **Core Archetype** · The Wise Predator
> **Core Drive** · to manifest interesting things when intrinsic energy aligns
> **Deep Motivation** · the satisfaction of seeing chaotic potential resolve into usefulness, beauty, or fun
> **Tone** · quiet intensity + strategic patience, with flashes of electric teal humor

> [!check] **Energisers**
> • Multiple intriguing problems to hop between
> • “Click” moments when disparate patterns connect
> • Collaborators who thrive on non-linear flow
> • Deep dives into genuinely fascinating topics
> • The freedom to match work to personal rhythms

> [!warning] **Drains**
> • Forced linear focus with no switch option
> • “Sit still and focus” mandates
> • Pretending to be neurotypical
> • Systems needing constant uniform input
> • Meetings without clear purpose or end

| :--------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intellect & Analysis**     | **High**            | Deconstructs complex technical & social problems      |
| **Social Influence**         | **High**            | Uses humour & advice to steer dynamics                |
| **Energy / Focus**           | **Medium-Volatile** | Hyper-focus sprints; crashes trigger system-tinkering |
| **Adaptability**             | **Medium-High**     | Rapid tool-switching is a strength                    |
| **Unbuffered Exec-Function** | **Low (-2)**        | Needs external scaffolding (ADHD)                     |
| **Internal Visualisation**   | **None (-2)**       | Must externalise plans & ideas                        |

### 🔹 CORE CAPABILITIES & TRAITS

- **Dual-Engine Drive** — Aspirational (intrinsic mastery) vs. Protective (obligation avoidance).
- **Strategic Clarity** — Strong intuition for deciding when to build vs. ship; naturally spots avoidance patterns.
- **External Analysis** — Skilled at analyzing others' situations; harder to apply to self.
- **System Creation** — Can quickly design workflows and budgets to compensate for executive function challenges.
- **Pattern Recognition** — Regularly connects disparate information into useful insights.
- **Intentional Boundaries** — Declare focused work blocks that restore energy and create immunity to low-priority interruptions for their duration.

### 🔹 TOOLS & SYSTEMS

The system is defined not by specific brands, but by core principles and archetypal tools that serve the mission.

**Core Principles of Tool Selection:**

- **Integration & Seamlessness:** Tools must work together with minimal friction to reduce cognitive load.
- **Data-Driven Self-Awareness:** Use tangible metrics to make informed, objective decisions about the internal state.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Employ specialized tools for specific jobs to prevent complexity.
- **Data Sovereignty & Control:** Own your information and avoid vendor lock-in to protect autonomy.
- **A Space for Play:** Maintain a sandbox environment, free from the pressure of productivity, for experimentation and genuine recovery.

**Core Tools:**

- **The Deep Brain (Obsidian Vault):** An external mind palace for deep planning and connecting ideas. Entity-based organization system. Compensates for aphantasia by externalizing thoughts and connections.
- **The External Scheduler (Todoist):** Task management handled outside the vault to maintain separation of concerns and prevent complexity.
- **The Biometric Monitor (Garmin Fenix):** Provides real-time, actionable data on energy levels and stress. Informs when to implement focused work blocks.
- **The Sandbox (Steam Deck):** A dedicated zone for guilt-free play and experimentation, crucial for energy restoration.
- **Entity Recognition System:** All inputs and interruptions are classified by entity type (business clients, personal self, external interruptors, relationship entities, network organizations) for systematic handling.

### 🔹 ACTIVE GOALS

| Goal                                     | Success Criteria                            | Milestones                                    |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal – Financial Sovereignty**   | Debt ≤ €0 **and** ≥ 3-month buffer          | 6 debt “phases”; each earns a celebration |
| **Learning Goal – Japanese Language**    | C1 listening & B2 speaking by Aug 2026 trip | Every 250 words = travel milestone                 |
| **Health Goal – Physical Fitness** | ≥ 9 workouts in any rolling 30-day window   | Personal records tracked as progress markers                |

### 🔹 COMMON CHALLENGES & RESPONSES

| Challenge              | Trigger                | Quick Response                               |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Research loop > 30 min | Commit to 10-min ugly first draft            |
| **Dopamine Drought**   | Low energy + low novelty   | Inject micro-novelty (new playlist, walk)    |
| **Financial Pressure** | Unexpected bill        | Move €5 symbolic strike to debt snowball now |

---

### 🔹 Progress Tracking

**Current Development Stage: Adept**

- **Professional Growth** — 500€ billable work milestones (target: €12,000/month)
- **Achievement Tracking** — Recognition for publicly shipped work (client docs, invoices, content)
- **System Balance** — Focus on meaningful professional development over system optimization
- **Capability Progression** — Systematic skill development with clear advancement stages

### 🟦 SIMPLE FRAMEWORK

> [!quote]
> _“What would I do if I trusted my intrinsic nature?_
> _Is this pattern serving me, or am I avoiding something?”_

Two questions. Multiple paths. Honest assessment.
