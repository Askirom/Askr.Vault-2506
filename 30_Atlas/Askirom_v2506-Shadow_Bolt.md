> A Shadow Bolt doesn't apologize for its nature; it simply knows the difference between emerging with purpose and sparking at random.

**Theme: The Chaotic Void** — An action is a focused strike of pure potential, drawn from the chaos of the void. It defines its own meaning, independent of external light or judgment.

### 🔹 PURPOSE & GOALS

1. **Real-Life Decision Framework** — “What would I do if I trusted my intrinsic nature?”
2. **Integrated Character Sheet** — Stats, abilities, gear, quests, and counters live _here_.
3. **Aspirational Growth Model** — Become someone who works _with_ their brain, not against it.

### 🔹 OPERATING CONTEXT

> [!info]
> • **ADHD** — external scaffolding is non-negotiable; proactive energy management beats brute discipline.
> • **Aphantasia** — zero internal visuals → writing, sketching, motion are core cognition.

- **System-Binder** — Weave workflows/budgets from the void to cancel Exec-Function penalty for one scene.
- **Pattern-Spotter** — 1× day connect two unrelated facts into a fresh insight.

### 🔹 LOADOUT & ARMORY

This character's loadout is defined not by specific brands, but by core principles and archetypal tools that serve the mission.

**Core Principles of Tool Selection:**

- **Integration & Seamlessness:** Tools must work together with minimal friction to reduce cognitive load.
- **Data-Driven Self-Awareness:** Use tangible metrics to make informed, objective decisions about the internal state.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Employ specialized tools for specific jobs to prevent complexity.
- **Data Sovereignty & Control:** Own your information and avoid vendor lock-in to protect autonomy.
- **A Space for Play:** Maintain a sandbox environment, free from the pressure of productivity, for experimentation and genuine recovery.

**Archetypal Gear:**

- **The Deep Brain (Obsidian Vault):** An external mind palace for deep planning and connecting ideas. Cancels the `Aphantasia` debuff.
- **The Inbox System (Obsidian Tasks):** Quick task capture in inbox file, organized within the vault system.
- **The Biometric HUD (Garmin Fenix):** Provides real-time, actionable data on personal Energy (MP) and stress. Informs when to use abilities like `Intentional Boundaries`.
- **The Sandbox (Steam Deck):** A dedicated zone for guilt-free play and experimentation, crucial for MP recovery.
