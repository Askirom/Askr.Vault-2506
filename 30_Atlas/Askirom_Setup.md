# Personal Framework for Clarity

*A resilient, cross-platform environment for professional craft and intentional living.*

*Hardware, software, and core principles are documented in `30 Atlas/Askirom Gear Inventory v2506.md` and `CLAUDE.md`*

## Key Workflows & Rhythms

The old, rigid workflows are replaced by a more natural, intentional rhythm.

### Daily Rhythm

1. **Morning Stillness**: Begin the day with quiet observation, not by checking devices. Understand your own state before engaging with the world's demands.
2. **Review Commitments**: Look at your Calendar for appointments. Look at Todoist for timely reminders. This is about what you've promised to others.
3. **Engage with the Work**: Open your `20 Quests/` and choose a project to engage with based on priority and natural energy. Your full attention is there.
4. **End-of-Day Reflection**: If an insight arose, capture it in your `30 Atlas/` or Journal. Empty your `99 To Sort/`. Close the system down and let your mind rest.

### Engaging with a Quest

1. A new project or goal gets its own folder within `20 Quests/`.
2. Relevant external knowledge is gathered and placed in `10 Library/` and linked to the quest notes.
3. All work—drafts, plans, notes—is done within the quest's folder.
4. Once complete, quest status is updated to completed.
5. Crucially, any wisdom gained from the experience is distilled into a new or existing note in `30 Atlas/`.

## Future Considerations

- **Backup Strategy**: Regular Obsidian vault backups via git.
- **Regular Reflection**: Weekly or monthly review, not of tasks, but of your `Atlas`. Are these principles still true? Have I learned something new?
- **Evolution**: All components are replaceable. The philosophy is the constant, not the tools.
