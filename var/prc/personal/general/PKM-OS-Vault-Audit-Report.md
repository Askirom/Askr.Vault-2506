  Check 1: PKM-OS Architecture Compliance

  File Naming Convention Violations

  CRITICAL FINDING: Your vault contains extensive naming convention violations. The PKM-OS v0.5 specification requires kebab-case naming (lowercase with hyphens), but the current
  vault contains:

  - 184+ files and folders with uppercase letters, spaces, or underscores
  - Examples include:
    - Vaultmap.yaml (should be vaultmap.yaml)
    - sys/CLAUDE.md (should be sys/claude.md)
    - sys/Personal-Knowledge-OS.md (should be sys/personal-knowledge-os.md)
    - lib/personal/VIM-QuickSheet.md (should be lib/personal/vim-quicksheet.md)
    - All project files like ARA-Project.md, SECUD-Project.md etc.
    - All daily logs like 2025-07-08.md (acceptable pattern)
    - Directory names like Attachments/, Games/, Licenses/

  Folder Structure

  ✅ COMPLIANT: All top-level folders conform to PKM-OS v0.5 structure:
  - var/ - Variable/working data
  - lib/ - Reference library
  - sys/ - System files
  - tmp/ - Temporary files
  - archive/ - Archived content

  Metadata and Filing Logic Violations

  MODERATE FINDINGS:

  1. Missing Type Fields:
    - sys/Personal-Knowledge-OS.md is missing required type: field
    - sys/CLAUDE.md is missing required type: field
  2. Filing Logic: ✅ All sampled files are correctly located according to their types:
    - Project files properly in var/prc/
    - Reference files properly in lib/
    - Daily logs properly in var/log/dly/
    - Templates properly in sys/tpl/
    - MOCs properly in sys/maps/

  Check 2: Link and Reference Integrity

  MODERATE FINDINGS: Several broken internal links detected:

  - In sys/CLAUDE.md: broken link to [[Name]] (example reference)
  - In lib/personal/VIM-QuickSheet.md: broken links to [[New Note Title]] and [[SECUD Audit Findings]]
  - In lib/network/Jan-Phillip-Scheller.md: broken link to [[_Quest-RBOMN]]

  These appear to be remnants from the migration process or placeholder content.

  Check 3: Conceptual Artifact Audit

  Greek Knowledge Style Artifacts

  ✅ CLEAN: No episteme, techne, or phronesis references found. The vault has successfully migrated away from philosophical categorization.

  Gamification Style Artifacts

  MAJOR FINDINGS: Extensive gamification artifacts remain throughout the vault:

  XP System References:
  - sys/maps/XP-Log.md - Entire file dedicated to XP tracking
  - sys/maps/Askirom-System-2025-07-08.md - Contains "XP System" section
  - sys/maps/Askirom-v2506-Shadow-Bolt.md - Contains "XP & LEVEL-UP" section

  Project Value Estimation in XP:
  - Multiple professional project files contain "Estimated Value: €X (Y XP)" notations
  - Examples: FITS (5 XP), RCG (2 XP), FDFRI (4 XP), EHFREI (3 XP)

  Personal Development Tracking:
  - var/prc/personal/Askirom-Evolution/ folder contains multiple references to "XP runs", "90% XP", "120% XP"
  - Stage-based progression system with XP terminology

  RECOMMENDATION: The vault requires a comprehensive cleanup to remove gamification language and replace it with concrete Action Log primitives (DRAFT, REVIEW, COMMUNICATE, PLAN,
  DECIDE) as specified in the PKM-OS design.

  ---
  SUMMARY: While the folder structure is compliant, the vault requires significant work on naming conventions and removal of legacy gamification artifacts to achieve full PKM-OS
  v0.5 compliance.
