# VdS 10000 Gap Analysis ✅

## Win Condition
Complete comprehensive VdS 10000 gap analysis including asset classification, current state assessment, and roadmap for implementation.

## VdS 10000 Context
**Phase:** `= this.vdsPhase` (assessment | implementation | certification)  
**System Scope:** `= this.systemScope` (critical | non-critical | both)  
**Project Value:** €`= this.estimatedValue`  
**Certification Target:** `= this.certificationDeadline`

## Completed Deliverables ✅
### Completed Items
- ISB designation (4.4.1 = Status 1 - Complete)
- VdS 10000 gap analysis audit ([[EMPIC-VdS10000 Audit.csv]])
- ISMS structure documentation (IS-200, IS-410, etc.)
- Organizational structure and responsibilities defined
- Basic security measures implemented (antivirus, firewalls, backups)

## Key Findings from Gap Analysis
**Strong Foundation:**
- ISB appointed and organizational structure defined
- Asset management and network documentation in place
- Basic security controls implemented (97% compliance on technical controls)
- Backup systems and network security functioning

**Critical Gaps Requiring Focus:**
- **Risk Management** (A.2.x - All Status 0): No VdS 10000 risk analysis performed
- **Critical System Classification** (9.x - Status 0): Need to identify critical systems
- **Policy Management** (6.x - Status 0): Policies created but not formally released
- **Change Management** (10.3.2, 10.6.6): No formal change process

## Progress Notes
Gap analysis completed and shows EMPIC has strong technical foundation but needs process formalization and risk management implementation.
