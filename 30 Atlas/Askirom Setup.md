# Personal Framework for Clarity

*A resilient, cross-platform environment for professional craft and intentional living.*

## Hardware Setup

### Primary Devices

- **MacBook Pro M1 Pro 16‚Äù** - Primary professional workstation
- **iPhone 15 Pro Max** - Mobile productivity and communication
- **iPad Pro 4th gen + Magic Keyboard** - Secondary mobile workstation, note-taking
- **Steam Deck** - Linux desktop environment, gaming, experimentation
- **Garmin Fenix 8** - Fitness tracking, notifications, time management

### Peripherals

- **Magic Keyboard with Touch ID** - Desktop input (portable for hybrid work)
- **Magic Trackpad** - Precision navigation (fits in tablet pocket)

## Core Principles

- **Clarity of Purpose**: The system must make things clearer, not more complex.
- **Simplicity over Complexity**: Choose the simplest tool and structure that works.
- **Inquiry over Assumption**: The system is a tool for asking questions, not just storing answers.
- **Effectiveness over Busyness**: The goal is results and peace of mind, not performing productivity.
- **Intentional Boundaries**: Maintain a clear, mindful separation between different areas of life.
- **Data Portability**: Retain ownership and control over personal data.

## Organizational Structure

### Obsidian Folder Hierarchy

The structure is simplified to reflect the flow of wisdom: from external knowledge, through active practice, to internalized understanding.

```

üìÅ 00_Inbox/ (Temporary holding area for new information)

üìÅ 10_Library/ (For received knowledge from others - articles, guides, standards)

üìÅ 20_Workshop/ (The active workshop for all projects and goals - personal & professional)

üìÅ 30_Insights/ (A curated, flat structure for your own discovered patterns and principles)

üìÅ 99_Archive/ (For completed projects and reference material)

```

### Todoist Project Structure

Todoist is now used for simple, actionable reminders, not complex project management. The deep work and context live in Obsidian's `Studio`.

```

## Backend Services & Data Flow
### Calendar & Scheduling
The calendar is a sacred boundary tool, used to protect your energy and honor your commitments.
It‚Äôs not a productivity theater or a detailed plan. Instead, it gives structure to the week by making external appointments visible and intentional work blocks non-negotiable.
- Primary Use:  
	- External: meetings, calls, shared events.
	- Internal: focused work sessions, deep work, recovery time.
- Philosophy:  
    Time-blocking is not rigid‚Äîit‚Äôs about declaring your intention for that window. You stay flexible, but the block is protected unless consciously renegotiated.
- Coordination:  
	- Shared calendars are used with girlfriend in your HIVE.
- Personal events are simple, clear, and energy-aware (e.g., ‚ÄúFocus: Client Draft‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuffer: Walk / Music‚Äù).
- Boundary Rule:  
	- If it matters, it‚Äôs on the calendar. If it‚Äôs on the calendar, it‚Äôs respected

### Notes & Knowledge

- **System**: Obsidian with Obsidian Sync
- **Structure**: `Library` (external knowledge) vs. `Studio` (active work) vs. `Atlas` (internal wisdom).

### Tasks & Projects

- **System**: Todoist Pro
- **Structure**: High-level areas of life. Specific project tasks are managed within the relevant notes in Obsidian's `Studio`.

## Key Workflows & Rhythms

The old, rigid workflows are replaced by a more natural, intentional rhythm.

### Daily Rhythm

1.  **Morning Stillness**: Begin the day with quiet observation, not by checking devices. Understand your own state before engaging with the world's demands.
2.  **Review Commitments**: Look at your Calendar for appointments. Look at Todoist for timely reminders. This is about what you've promised to others.
3.  **Engage with the Work**: Open your `20_Studio/` and choose a project to engage with based on priority and natural energy. Your full attention is there.
4.  **End-of-Day Reflection**: If an insight arose, capture it in your `30_Atlas/` or Journal. Empty your `00_Inbox/`. Close the system down and let your mind rest.

### Engaging with a Project

1.  A new project or goal gets its own folder within `20_Studio/`.
2.  Relevant external knowledge is gathered and placed in `10_Library/` and linked to the project notes.
3.  All work‚Äîdrafts, plans, notes‚Äîis done within the project's `Studio` folder.
4.  Once complete, the project folder is moved to `99_Archive/`.
5.  Crucially, any wisdom gained from the experience is distilled into a new or existing note in `30_Atlas/`.

## Future Considerations

- **Backup Strategy**: Regular Obsidian vault backups.
- **Regular Reflection**: Weekly or monthly review, not of tasks, but of your `Atlas`. Are these principles still true? Have I learned something new?
- **Evolution**: All components are replaceable. The philosophy is the constant, not the tools.
