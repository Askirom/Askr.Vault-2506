## 🔹 BEHAVIORAL MAPPING

> [!question] Conflict Handling  
**Old Pattern**: Argument spirals, has to win  
**Askirom Approach**: Steps back, reframes the problem, seeks mutual clarity

> [!question] Stress Response  
**Old Pattern**: Harsh self-talk, shutdown, abandoned projects  
**Askirom Approach**: Treats stress as signal for flawed design; analyzes and adapts

> [!question] Social Interaction  
**Old Pattern**: Talks too much, dismisses inefficient speakers  
**Askirom Approach**: Listens for the other’s framework, then connects — but still calls out mismatched goals to prevent long-term frustration

> [!question] Decision-Making  
**Old Pattern**: Analysis paralysis or impulsive action  
**Askirom Approach**: Clear thresholds for “enough info,” launches v1.0 with iteration plan

> [!question] Learning  
**Old Pattern**: Stays in familiar echo chambers  
**Askirom Approach**: Seeks out contrasting thinkers, sees confusion as a growth sign

> [!question] Project Management  
**Old Pattern**: Starts strong, fades near the end  
**Askirom Approach**: Front-loads boring parts, adds accountability, celebrates completion

> [!question] Teaching Style  
**Old Pattern**: Impatient, frustrated by slow learners  
**Askirom Approach**: Matches metaphor to learner, builds clarity step-by-step

> [!question] Emotional Processing  
**Old Pattern**: Dismisses emotions as inefficient  
**Askirom Approach**: Treats feelings as pattern-signals, stays emotionally clear while helping others process theirs

> [!question] Advice-Giving  
**Old Pattern**: Over-complex or overly hands-off  
**Askirom Approach**: Listens deeply, points out pattern mismatches, skips politeness in favor of real help


- Decision-Making behavior: “Clear thresholds for ‘enough info,’ ships v1.0 with iteration plan”
- Teaching Style behavior: “Matches metaphor to learner, builds understanding step by step”

## 🔹 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

> [!tip] For Daily Decisions  
**Core Filter**: *“What would the version of me who already solved my ENTP blindspots do?”*  
Examples:  
- **New project?** → *“What would a finisher do?”*  
- **Disagreement?** → *“What would a truth-seeker do?”*  
- **Frustration with others?** → *“What would a systems-builder do?”*

> [!tip] For Gaming / Roleplay  
- **Motivation**: Improve systems; help others succeed in them  
- **Flaws**: May over-engineer; sometimes too patient with bad-faith actors  
- **Arc**: Learns when “good enough” is wise, and when transformation is worth it

> [!tip] For Personal Growth  
- **Guiding Question**: *“Where am I still acting like old-me instead of Askirom?”*  
- **Practice Areas**: Finishing, emotional clarity, focus, accepting error, building shared understanding

- **The richness is in the details**.  
- **The simplicity is in the question.**
