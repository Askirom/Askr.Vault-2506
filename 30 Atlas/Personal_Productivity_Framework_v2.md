## Core Principles

- **Clarity of Purpose** — The system must make things clearer, not more complex  
- **Simplicity over Complexity** — Choose the simplest tool and structure that works  
- **Inquiry over Assumption** — Use the system to ask better questions, not just store answers  
- **Effectiveness over Busyness** — Focus on outcomes and peace of mind, not performance  
- **Intentional Boundaries** — Protect energy with clear separations between life areas  
- **Data Portability** — Own your data. Favor open formats and exportable systems

## Backend Services & Data Flow

### 📆 Calendar & Scheduling

- **Purpose** — Protect energy and honor commitments (external & internal)  
- **Use**  
  - External: meetings, calls, shared events  
  - Internal: deep work, focus blocks, recovery  
- **Philosophy** — Time blocks express intent. Respected unless consciously renegotiated  
- **Coordination** — Shared calendars with `HIVE` (e.g., girlfriend)  
- **Principle** — If it matters, it’s on the calendar. If it’s on the calendar, it’s respected

### 🧠 Notes & Knowledge

- **System** — Obsidian with Sync  
- **Structure**  
  - `Library`: external input, by life area  
  - `Workshop`: all active projects, by life area  
  - `Insights`: distilled truths and timeless patterns (flat)

### ✅ Tasks & Projects

- **System** — Todoist Pro  
- **Structure**  
  - Life areas: ⚡ PERSONAL, 🏢 PROFESSIONAL, ❤️ HIVE, 👥 NETWORK  
  - Todoist = surface-level reminders  
  - Obsidian = deep planning and context in `Workshop`

## Organizational Structure

### Obsidian Folder Hierarchy

The system mirrors the flow of knowledge: from external input, through action, into distilled insight.

- 📁 00_Inbox/ — Temporary holding area for new information
- 📁 10_Library/ — External knowledge, sorted by life area
- 📁 20_Workshop/ — Active workspaces for projects and goals, by life area
- 📁 30_Insights/ — Flat structure for distilled patterns and truths
- 📁 99_Archive/ — Completed projects and reference
### Todoist Project Structure

Todoist is used for lightweight reminders and actions. Structure mirrors Obsidian.

- ⭐ **Inbox / Today** — Quick capture and current focus  
- ❤️ **HIVE** — Home, relationship, shared life  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **NETWORK** — Friends, professional connections  
- ⚡ **PERSONAL** — Health, growth, self-maintenance  
- 🏢 **PROFESSIONAL** — Client work, income, development

## Key Workflows & Rhythms

### 🌅 Daily Rhythm

1. **Morning Stillness** — Begin with quiet awareness, no devices  
2. **Review Commitments** — Check Calendar and Todoist for today's shape  
3. **Engage the Work** — Open `20_Workshop/`, follow energy and clarity  
4. **Evening Reflection** — Capture insights in `30_Insights/`, clear `00_Inbox/`, shut down cleanly

### 🛠 Engaging a Project

1. Create a folder in `20_Workshop/`  
2. Collect relevant info in `10_Library/`  
3. Build, iterate, and plan within the project folder  
4. Archive when complete → `99_Archive/`  
5. Extract learnings to `30_Insights/`

## Future Considerations

- 🔁 **Backup Strategy** — Regular Obsidian vault backups  -> as of 2025-06-28 done with GitHub
- 🔍 **Reflection Cadence** — Weekly or monthly reviews focused on `Insights`  
- 🔄 **Evolvability** — Tools are temporary. The structure and clarity are permanent
