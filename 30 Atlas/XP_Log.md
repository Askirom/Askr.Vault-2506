## Professional XP System
**Rule:** 500€ billable work = 1 XP  
**Target:** 24 XP/month = 12,000€/month

**Analysis at 100€/hour:**
- 500€ = 5 billable hours per XP
- Monthly target: 120 billable hours (24 XP × 5 hours)
- This is **75% utilization** in a 160-hour month
- Conservative target that accounts for admin, sales, and buffer time

**Ship XP Bonus:** Additional XP for publicly shipped work (client deliverables, invoices, blog posts, case studies)

## Personal XP System  
**Rule:** Milestone completion = Variable XP based on impact  
**Examples:**
- Learning milestones: 1-2 XP (language chapters, courses)
- Health milestones: 1-3 XP (fitness goals, habits)
- Creative milestones: 2-5 XP (projects, side ventures)

**Focus:** Progress and achievement rather than time tracking

## Total XP: 45 XP (Current Level: ?)

**XP Breakdown:**
- Professional: 33 XP (€16,500+ billed)
- Personal: 10 XP (learning & development)
- System: 2 XP (optimization & organization)

## Level System (To Be Defined)
**Questions for consideration:**
- How much XP per level? (50 XP? 100 XP? Monthly targets?)
- What unlocks at each level? (Skills, abilities, rewards?)
- How complex should attributes/skills be?

**Potential Level Thresholds:**
- Level 1: 0-50 XP (Tutorial Stage)
- Level 2: 51-150 XP (Adept Stage) 
- Level 3: 151-300 XP (Expert Stage)
- Level 4: 301+ XP (Master Stage)

**Keep it simple vs. add complexity?**
