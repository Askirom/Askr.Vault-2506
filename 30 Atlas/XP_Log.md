## Professional XP System
**Rule:** 500€ billable work = 1 XP  
**Target:** 24 XP/month = 12,000€/month

**Analysis at 100€/hour:**
- 500€ = 5 billable hours per XP
- Monthly target: 120 billable hours (24 XP × 5 hours)
- This is **75% utilization** in a 160-hour month
- Conservative target that accounts for admin, sales, and buffer time

**Ship XP Bonus:** Additional XP for publicly shipped work (client deliverables, invoices, blog posts, case studies)

## Personal XP System  
**Rule:** Milestone completion = Variable XP based on impact  
**Examples:**
- Learning milestones: 1-2 XP (language chapters, courses)
- Health milestones: 1-3 XP (fitness goals, habits)
- Creative milestones: 2-5 XP (projects, side ventures)

**Focus:** Progress and achievement rather than time tracking
