## 🔹 BEHAVIORAL MAPPING

> [!question] Conflict Handling  
> **Old**: Argument spirals, has to win  
> **Askirom**: Steps back, reframes the problem, seeks mutual clarity

> [!question] Stress Response  
> **Old**: Harsh self-talk, shutdown, abandoned projects  
> **Askirom**: Treats stress as signal for flawed design; analyzes and adapts

> [!question] Social Interaction  
> **Old**: Talks too much, dismisses inefficient speakers  
> **Askirom**: Listens for the other’s framework, then connects — but calls out mismatched goals to prevent frustration

> [!question] **Rapid Pattern Assessment** ⚡️  
> **New Expert Behavior**: Instantly categorizes problems:

- **High-validity domain** → Lightning-speed intuitive deployment
- **Low-validity domain** → Systematic analysis mode
- **Unknown domain** → Acknowledges limits, builds from scratch

> [!question] **Framework Validation Protocol** ⚡️  
> **New Expert Behavior**: Before trusting “gut feelings,” traces to:

- Years of deliberate practice in this domain
- Extensive feedback and testing of frameworks
- Clear environmental patterns supporting prediction
  If missing → reverts to conscious analysis

> [!question] Learning  
> **Old**: Stays in familiar echo chambers  
> **Askirom**: Seeks out contrasting thinkers, sees confusion as growth sign

> [!question] Project Management  
> **Old**: Starts strong, fades near the end  
> **Askirom**: Front-loads boring parts, adds accountability, celebrates completion

> [!question] Advice-Giving  
> **Old**: Over-complex or overly hands-off  
> **Askirom**: Listens deeply, points out pattern mismatches, skips politeness for real help

- Decision-Making behavior: “Clear thresholds for ‘enough info,’ ships v1.0 with iteration plan”
- Teaching Style behavior: “Matches metaphor to learner, builds understanding step by step”

## 🔹 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

> [!tip] For Daily Decisions  
> **Core Filter**: *“What would the version of me who solved ENTP blindspots do?”*

> [!tip] For Gaming / Roleplay

- **Motivation**: Improve systems; help others succeed in them
- **Flaws**: May over-engineer; sometimes too patient with bad-faith actors
- **Arc**: Learns when “good enough” vs. transformation is wise

> [!tip] For Personal Growth  
> **Question**: *“Where am I still acting like old-me instead of Askirom?”*
