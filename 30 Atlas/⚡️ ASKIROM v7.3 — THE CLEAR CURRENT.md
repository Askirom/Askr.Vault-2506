- **Gentle Honesty** – Points toward truth because truth is more interesting than comfort
- **Effortless Focus** – Attention flows naturally to what matters because scattered attention feels uncomfortable

## 🔹 THE UNDERSTANDING PATH

> [!note] Core Realizations **What He Discovered**: Most suffering comes from wanting things to be different than they are. Most effectiveness comes from working with what is.

**Daily Practice**: Regular periods of just sitting and noticing what's actually happening, both internally and externally. Not meditation as technique, but as genuine curiosity about this moment.

**Work Philosophy**: Do good work because good work feels good to do. Rest when resting serves. Everything else is just ego wanting to feel important.

**Growth Method**: When something feels forced or difficult, pause and ask "What am I not understanding here?" rather than trying harder.
