## 2 Linking Strategy

**Person references**: Use `[[Name]]` format
- Creates bidirectional connections automatically
- Store person notes in `10 Library/NETWORK/`

**Document references**: Use `[[filename]]` for related files
- No complex tagging needed
- Folder structure provides organization

## 3 Core Principles

- **Direct linking** over complex tagging
- **Folder organization** handles categorization
- **Minimal thinking** required when creating notes
- **Date-based naming** for time-sensitive work (YYYY-MM-DD format)
