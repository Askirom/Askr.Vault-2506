# 📌 Introduction
This Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) evaluates the legal and practical implications of transferring personal data from Germany (EU) to a data importer in **Morocco**, under the **GDPR** using **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**.

# 📖 Legal Methodology & Basis
* Based on: **GDPR Art. 46**, **CJEU Schrems II (C-311/18)**
* Morocco has **no adequacy decision** (GDPR Art. 45)
* SCCs require **case-by-case verification** of effective safeguards

⠀
# 🇲🇦 Moroccan Legal Framework
### 🛡️ Law No. 09-08 – Personal Data Protection
* Based on Directive 95/46/EC (pre-GDPR)
* Includes principles of:
  * Fair & lawful processing
  * Purpose limitation
  * Data minimization
  * Accuracy & storage limitation
* Sensitive data: Explicit consent + CNDP authorization

⠀⚖️ Scope & Exemptions
* **Not applicable** to national security, state defense, public safety, or crime prevention
* These areas fall under separate legal regimes (outside CNDP oversight)
⠀
# 🧾 Legal Bases for Processing
* Default: **Freely given, specific, informed consent**
* Exceptions:
  * Contractual necessity
  * Legal obligation
  * Vital interests
  * Public interest/official authority
  * Legitimate interest (CNDP applies narrow interpretation)

⠀
# 🔐 Data Subject Rights (under Law 09-08)
* Right of access, rectification, objection
* Complaint channels: CNDP or judicial police
* Concerns:
  * Judiciary lacks full independence
  * Enforcement effectiveness questionable

⠀
# 🏛️ CNDP – Moroccan DPA
### Mandate & Powers
* Investigative, corrective, sanctioning, and advisory powers
* Lacks oversight in **security, defense, and criminal** contexts
* Members appointed by the King → potential conflict of interest

### Transparency Issues
* Sanction data not publicly available
* Limited public reporting on enforcement or gov requests

⠀
# ❌ Adequacy Decision Status
* **No EU adequacy decision**
* Transfers to Morocco require SCCs + supplementary measures

⠀
# 🔁 Data Transfer Rules (Moroccan Law)
* CNDP authorization required for outbound transfers
* Inbound SCCs: **No official Moroccan position**, but contract clauses recognized

⠀
# 🏛️ Government Access to Data
### ⚖️ Legal Bases
* Constitution Art. 24: Judicial oversight for interference
* CPC: Warrants for search/seizure/interception
* Anti-Terrorism Law 03-03:
  * Extended police custody
  * “Extreme urgency” clause enables warrantless access
* Telecom Law 24-96:
  * Retention vaguely defined
  * Broad access for defense/public security

⠀🚨 Surveillance Practices
* Reports of:
  * **Pegasus spyware**
  * **Eagle** (mass DPI)
  * **Evident** (BAE Systems tool)
* Targeting journalists, activists, critics
* Surveillance likely exceeds narrow legal authorization

⠀
# 🔍 Oversight Gaps
* **CNDP not competent for surveillance oversight**
* Judiciary: Reported lack of independence
* No dedicated body with binding oversight authority

⠀
# 🔐 Encryption & Data Localization
* Use of encryption tools regulated (Law 53-05)
* Encryption may require **prior authorization**
* Data localization required for "secret" data (Law 05-20 & Decree 2-24-921)

⠀
# 🧭 Redress Mechanisms
### 🧾 Against Private Actors
* CNDP complaints
* Court action (but judiciary concerns persist)

⠀❌ Against Government
* Limited transparency
* CNDP has no authority
* Judiciary lacks independence
* Remedies **formally exist** but rarely **effective in practice**

⠀
# ⚠️ Conclusion: No Essential Equivalence
Key Findings:
* No adequacy decision
* Broad government access powers
* Weak enforcement + oversight gaps
* Judicial independence concerns
* Effective redress not ensured

⠀
# ✅ Recommendations: Supplementary Measures
### 📄 Contractual
* Government request transparency obligation
* Legal review + challenge clause
* Data minimization
* Subject notification where possible
* Regular legal review

⠀🔐 Technical
* Strong E2EE (exporter controls keys)
* Pseudonymization
* Minimized datasets
* Secure processing infrastructure
* Cloud services: Must assess local presence requirement

⠀🏢 Organizational
* Written government request procedures
* Transparency reporting (importer → exporter)
* Audit rights
* Staff training
* Annual reassessment

⠀
# 📌 Final Note
This TIA was prepared as of the current understanding of Moroccan law and practice. Surveillance and legal environments evolve — continuous monitoring is required.
