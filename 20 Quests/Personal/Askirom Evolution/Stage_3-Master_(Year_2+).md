### 2 · Daily & Weekly Rhythm — “Invisible System”

- **Morning Cue (1 min)** – glance at Quest Log & mentee status.  
- **Deep-Work Cadence** – operates on instinct; still aim for ≥ 2 blocks/day but no formal logging unless drift is felt.  
- **Friday 20-min Heartbeat** – quick scan of KPIs; if any lag by > 10 %, schedule a focused intervention next week.

### 4 · Annual Cycles

| Q | Audit | Action |
|---|-------|--------|
| Q1 | **Life Alignment Review** | Check if quests still match values; prune or add. |
| Q2 | **Cert Refresher** | Complete CPD hours; schedule audit shadowing. |
| Q3 | **System Stress-Test** | Purposefully overload one week (120 % XP) and watch for cracks. |
| Q4 | **Celebrate & Reset** | Retreat day: reflect, journal, and set next year’s headline quest. |

### 5 · Capstone Quest — “Life-Level Achievement”

Reach **one major life goal** explicitly tracked in Active Quests  
(e.g., “Financial Sovereignty,” “C1 in Japanese,” “Finish Kona Ironman”) **while maintaining** all Core Objective metrics for 12 months.  
When cleared, the system is considered *permanent gear*—future quests merely slot in.
